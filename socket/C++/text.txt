A panda looks like a little bear. It has black and white fur. It lives only in China, so it is called the national treasure of China and protected by the law.

We all see panda on TV or in the zoo. They look stupid and walk slowly, but they are lovely and everyone likes them.

A panda is lucky animal. We Chinese like it, and people of the world like it, too. Now there are China’s pandas in many other countries, such as Japan and the USA…

A panda isn’t a common animal, it is bridge of friendship.
